- Representative techniques of evolutionary operations that mimic the evolution of living things (a kind of search algorithm)
     1) List possible solutions(gene) to the problem
     2) Generation solutions with high accuracy by changing genes
     3) Recognizing evolution by getting good solution and changing genes

- Using various term
*Generation, Population, Mutation, Crossover
